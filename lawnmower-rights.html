                    <h2>The Basics</h2>
                    <p>
                        Lawn mower rights aren’t a good idea at all. If you disagree with that, 
			then you need to read this for your own sanity, and I have a beachfront 
			property in Kansas for you. Lawn mowers were made by humans, and we 
			definitely would know if lawn mowers had feelings, because we made them. 
			Sure, you have lawn mowers that can mow on their own, but all they did 
			was slap a few sensors on a lawn mower. Lawn mowers can’t think at all, 
			therefore, making them less intelligent than a slug.
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Contrary to belief on a website https://lmra-org.web.app, lawnmowers 
			normally aren’t used as pets, and rarely as experiments, although the 
			average IQ of a person nowadays is one of a third grader. 
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Farmers aren’t evil (opposing https://lmra-org.web.app again.), they 
			provide a lot of food to the U.S., and other areas. They mow their 
			lawns to make them look good, like the LMRA people said, 
			“lawn mowers...gives them beautifully flourished grass”. It is necessary 
			to mow over weeds, and it isn’t bad at all for lawn mowers.

                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
			If you support lawn mower rights, then this is for you. Lawn mowers can’t 
			think, therefore making them dumber than a slug that eats Plutonium. Giving 
			lawn mowers rights is outrageous, and should be stopped at all costs. If we 
			need to, we will round them up on the streets, and show how defenseless they 
			are. Whatever it takes to put our society back together. We are here for 
			everyone who believes lawn mowers deserve rights.
		    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
			Below, we have a few arguments against, and for the idea that lawn mowers have rights.
		    </p>
                    <br />
                    <h2>Arguments For Lawn Mower Rights</h2>
                    <p>
                        The only place that was found from our web searchers that support lawn mower 
			rights was the LMRA site. According to LMRA, “Halting the widespread use of 
			lawn mowers would also eliminate the systematic cruelty and denial of choice 
			that lawn mower industries perpetuate. The physical and psychological pain 
			endured by lawn mowers has reached a point many consider to be unacceptable. 
			Humans mutilate lawn mowers in several different ways, including unnecessary 
			modifications and being forced to mow weeds and grass for the majority of their 
			life.”
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        I don’t really know what to say after reading this, but LAWN MOWERS AREN’T 
			FORCED TO CUT GRASS, THEY AREN’T FORCED TO DO ANYTHING, THEY DON’T HAVE FEELINGS!! 
			I am seriously disgruntled, and genuinely scared about what will happen in the 
			future. About the physical and psychological part, lawn mowers can’t feel or think. How 
			many times will I have to say that??
                    </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>
                        Another argument by the LMRA: “Lawn mowers in modern times have had to do much more work 
			than they ever had to before the 19th Century. In 1922, genetically modified lawn mowers 
			were developed. These new modified lawn mowers are now required to push themselves, in 
			addition to cutting the grass. Instead of praising the lawn mowers for their added duties, 
			companies merely branded them as ‘Self-Propelling’ and sold them for higher prices.”
                    </p>
		    <br />
                    <p>
			First off, lawn mowers can’t reproduce. That wouldn’t even be remotely possible in any way 
			at all whatsoever. Second, we shouldn’t praise a hunk of metal ordered in a way that it can 
			spin a blade and move by itself. 
		    </p>
		    <br />
                    <h2>Arguments Against Lawn Mowers</h2>
		    <p>
			Now, this part might make some of the LMRA members cry. But here we go. This is the definition 
			of a lawn mower: “A machine for cutting the grass on a lawn.” Did you hear the words ‘lawn mower’ 
			and ‘feeling’ next to each other? Nope. ‘Feeling’ wasn't even mentioned in the definition, and 
			neither was ‘rights’.  Lawn mower rights aren’t real at all.
		    </p>
		    <br />
		    <p>
			Companies like John Deere and Cub Cadet that make lawn mowers wouldn’t try to hide the fact at all 
			that lawn mowers have feelings, and don’t you think that lawn mowers would be able to move on their 
			own without a human if they were alive? And if they only moved when they were being hunted, then why 
			wouldn't they move because the humans are hurting them all the time, physically and psychologically? 
			The facts just don’t match up for the LMRA people. 
		    </p>
		    <br />
		    <p>
			Here are a few quotes from students about the LMRA: “this organization is unleaded...lawn mowers 
			don’t need rights.”, said an anonymous student, for their safety. And “My mom and dad haven’t allowed 
			me on the internet after they saw the LMRA webpage.” Lastly, we have another annonymus student, "If a
			living thing needs an key ignition to make it start, it probably isn't alive."
